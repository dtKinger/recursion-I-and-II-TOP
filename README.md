# Recursion I and II - The Odin Project

## I - Recursive Fibonacci sequence
- Written iteratively at first, then adapted to recursive style.

## II - custom mergeSort algorithm using recursion
- Divide and conquer technique
- Uses more RAM but faster sorting technique compared to bubble, insertion, and selection sorts
